## Mobile Interactions

### Touch Optimizations
- **Minimum touch targets**: 44px for all interactive elements
- **Swipe gestures**: Testimonial carousel, image galleries
- **Pull-to-refresh**: Disabled (single-page experience)
- **Scroll momentum**: Smooth native scrolling

### Responsive Behaviors
- **Collapsible sections**: Accordion-style on mobile
- **Sticky CTAs**: Bottom-fixed on mobile screens
- **Full-screen forms**: Modal overlays for better UX
- **Image optimization**: Progressive loading with placeholders

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Page Load Sequence
1. **Hero content**: Fade-in with stagger (200ms delays)
2. **Cards**: Slide-up from bottom with bounce easing
3. **Images**: Progressive reveal with blur-to-sharp effect
4. **CTAs**: Pulse animation to draw attention

### Hover States
- **Buttons**: Color transition (300ms) + scale (1.05x)
- **Cards**: Lift effect with shadow expansion
- **Images**: Subtle zoom (1.1x) with overlay fade-in
- **Links**: Underline animation from left to right

### Loading States
- **Form submission**: Button spinner with "Sending..." text
- **Image loading**: Skeleton with shimmer effect
- **WhatsApp redirect**: "Connecting you to MaplePrints..." overlay
- **File upload**: Progress bar with percentage

## Accessibility Considerations

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab order**: Logical flow through interactive elements
- **Focus indicators**: High-contrast outlines
- **Skip links**: Hidden navigation for screen readers
- **ARIA labels**: Descriptive labels for all interactive elements

### Screen Reader Support
- **Alt text**: Descriptive text for all images
- **Form labels**: Properly associated with inputs
- **Status updates**: Live regions for dynamic content
- **Navigation**: Semantic HTML structure

## Performance Optimizations

### Loading Strategy
- **Critical CSS**: Inline above-the-fold styles
- **Image lazy loading**: Intersection observer implementation
- **Font loading**: Font-display: swap for web fonts
- **Script defer**: Non-critical JavaScript loads after content

### Interaction Feedback
- **Instant response**: Visual feedback within 100ms
- **Progressive enhancement**: Core functionality without JavaScript
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
- **Offline support**: Basic functionality when WhatsApp fails

This interaction design ensures a smooth, conversion-focused experience that guides users through the purchase journey while maintaining the premium, trustworthy brand image.
